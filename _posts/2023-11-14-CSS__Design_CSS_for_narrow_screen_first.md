It's easier to start with the mobile layout and to add our styles as the screen get wider than to start with wide-screen layout and have to override previously set layout elements as screens become smaller.

+  Narrow (most phones)—Maximum width of 549 pixels
 + Medium (tablets and small screens)—Between 500 and 955 pixels
 + Wide (desktop computers and high-resolution tablets)—Wider than 955 pixels
