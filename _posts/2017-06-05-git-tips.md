# bitbucket fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly

现象： git clone 结束时出现：

```bash
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (6224/6224), done.
Connection to bitbucket.org closed by remote host.9.00 KiB/s    
fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
fatal: early EOF
fatal: index-pack failed
```

方案：

It seems like the commit size was too big (default is &lt; 1Mbyte).

Resolved it with rising the limit up to 500Mbytes:

```bash
$ git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000
```
