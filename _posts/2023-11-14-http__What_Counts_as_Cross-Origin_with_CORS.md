When it comes to HTTP, an [origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/origin) is defined by several different aspects of the URL. This is important for understanding what qualifies as _same_ and _cross_-origin when dealing with
[CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) (Cross-Origin
Resource Sharing).

For something to be  *same-origin*, it must have the same scheme (HTTP/HTTPS),
the same host, and the same port. If any one of the scheme, host (including subdomains), or port is different, then it is not  *same-origin*.

Here are some examples of different origins:

- `https://example.com` vs `http://example.com` (different scheme)
- `https://example.com` vs `https://sub.example.com` (different host)
- `https://example.com:3000` vs `https://example.com:5000` (different port)

As long as the scheme, host, and port match, they are the same origin. The path (everything following the origin) doesn't factor into the question of same origin.
